// # Directive Controller Factory
// While we want to use the component controller, we need a way to add our own
// properties to the controller instance before the constructor is called. We also
// want to do this in the context of Angular's DI so that we can access the $element
// for events and $filter for properties.
//
// ## Setup
// We'll need a1atscript's propertiesBuilder for generating the property definitions
import {propertiesBuilder} from './properties-builder';
// Also need the eventsBuilder for creating event emittors
import eventsBuilder from './events-builder';

// ## Factory
// Needs the injection array, the controller class, and the directive definition
// object in order to generate the controller
export default function createDirectiveController(caller, injects, controller, ddo, $injector, locals){
  // Create an instance of the controller without calling its constructor
  let instance = Object.create(controller.prototype);
  // Use a1atscript's propertiesBuilder to add the getters/setters then sugar
  // over `=` and `@` bindings
  for(let key in ddo.properties){
    propertiesBuilder(instance, key, ddo.properties[key]);
  }
  // Remember, angular has alrady set those bindings on the prototype of the calling
  // function. Now we need to extend them onto our instance. important
  // to extend after building the properties that way we fire the setters
  Object.assign(instance, caller);

  // Finally, invoke the constructor using the injection array and the captured
  // locals
  $injector.invoke([...injects, controller], instance, locals);

  // Events work similarly, but they need the raw $element and the $scope for
  // destroying event observables.
  let {$element, $scope} = locals;
  eventsBuilder(instance, $element[0], $scope, ddo.events || {});

  // Return the controller instance
  return instance;
}
